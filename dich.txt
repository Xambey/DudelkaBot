Hi, sorry for my English. I've a problem with my ChatBot, for some reason it cannot send the message in a whisper for most users.(except my primary account and an account of my friend, that the bot sends a whisper, WHY?). My bot is connected to irc.chat.twitch.tv port 6667. Everything works except the whisper:(. 

:tmi.twitch.tv 004 dudelkabot :-
:tmi.twitch.tv 002 dudelkabot :Your host is tmi.twitch.tv
:tmi.twitch.tv 003 dudelkabot :This server is rather new
:tmi.twitch.tv 375 dudelkabot :-
:tmi.twitch.tv 001 dudelkabot :Welcome, GLHF!
:tmi.twitch.tv 376 dudelkabot :>
:tmi.twitch.tv 372 dudelkabot :You are in a maze of twisty passages, all alike.
:tmi.twitch.tv CAP * ACK :twitch.tv/membership
:tmi.twitch.tv CAP * ACK :twitch.tv/commands
:tmi.twitch.tv CAP * ACK :twitch.tv/tags

I want to ask you to check the whisper of my bot on the server group. I think the problem is on the server side(
bot name: DudelkaBot
primary account name Dudelka_Krasnaya
friend account name: craynet2

AND
my global ip: 194.135.232.150 , may be my ip is banned? (Russian Federation)

P.S  I was trying to connect with another account, the same result. 
P.S.S Earlier the whisper was not working
P.S.S.S Also, if possible, the bot can add to the whitelist? It will write a lot of posts in a whisper (long list of commands and responses)
